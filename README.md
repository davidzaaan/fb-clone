## See my friends list

As you're new in the social media, you will have no friends yet. That is why you will be recommended some profiles to start adding them to your friend's list. Add them all!
*(People appearing currently in the `People you may know` section may vary when you create your profile).*

Ok, so now that you have sent some friend requests (And the people you sent them to, have accepted), you could see your friend's list.
It will look something like this...

With each profile card that you see, you will have two options with your new friends.
#### 1. Add them to you Close Friends list
Click on the green button that says `Add to Close Friends` below the profile image, and your friend's list will be updated with the new friend you added
